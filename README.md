# Multi QnA bot using Langchain

This project allows users to chat with multiple PDF documents by leveraging Langchain, Google Generative AI, and FAISS for building an efficient question-answering (QnA) bot. Users can upload PDFs, process them into chunks, and ask questions, while the chatbot searches for relevant answers within the PDFs and responds using a generative AI model. The botâ€™s behavior, including response word limit and creativity (temperature), can be customized via user input.
## Features

- Upload multiple PDF documents.
- Split the documents into smaller chunks for processing.
- Use FAISS to store and retrieve vector embeddings for fast similarity search.
- Interact with Google Generative AI (Gemini) for generating human-like responses.
- Adjust response creativity using a temperature setting.
- Control the response word limit as per your requirements.
- Easy-to-use interface with Streamlit.
